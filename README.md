# Prediction-Medical-Cost
This project analyzes and predicts medical insurance costs using machine learning models. It provides insights into how different factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region affect healthcare expenses.


🩺 Medical Cost Prediction 
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on personal factors. It uses regression models to identify the factors that most influence an individual's insurance costs. The models used are Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Neighbors Regressor.
📁Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset
This dataset contains 1,338 individual data points with seven input features, including age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and charges. 
⚙ Tools 
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook/VS Code 
🎯 Purpose of Analysis
Predicting an individual's medical insurance costs based on lifestyle and demographic data.
Identifying the features that most influence insurance costs.
Comparing the performance of different regression models.
🔎 Steps 
1. Data Loading & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Reading datasets using Pandas
Checking missing values and descriptive statistics
Analysing relationships between variables with heatmaps and scatter plots
2. Feature Engineering
Create additional features, such as:
BMI_Category → categorises BMI values into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese
Age_Group → grouping ages into the categories Young, Adult, Senior
Smoker_BMI_Interaction → combined effect of smoking and high BMI on insurance costs


One-hot encoding for categorical features
3. Data Splitting & Scaling
Split the data into train (80%) and test (20%)
Normalise numerical features using StandardScaler
4. Modeling
Model used:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
K-Neighbors Regressor
5. Evaluation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
📊 Visualization
Linear Regression showed the best performance with the highest R² value and the smallest error.
The most influential features were smoker, age, and BMI.
The scatter plot showed that smokers with high BMI had significantly higher insurance costs.
🧠Insight
Smokers incur much higher insurance costs than non-smokers.
Older age → higher insurance costs.
High BMI → higher insurance costs.
Region & number of children → less impact.
Combined effects (BMI_smoker & age_smoker) → amplify costs.
Among all the models tested, Random Forest performed best in predicting insurance charges, demonstrating its ability to identify non-linear relationships in the data. Linear regression showed the highest R² score (0.8869), indicating better overall suitability and consistency in the data. Therefore, linear regression was selected as the final model for this project due to its strong balance between readability and prediction accuracy.
